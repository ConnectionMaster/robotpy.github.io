title: RobotPy 2025 Beta is now available
---

There is no updated documentation at this time. To install the beta release, you can
do `pip install robotpy==2025.0.0b1`. See our normal documentation for installation,
deployment, etc -- most things haven't changed.

* NavX and phoenix6 vendor libraries are available at this time

If you're interested in helping with RobotPy, there's lots to do and we'd love your help!
